        <p>
            After years of feeling like there must be more to life and asking myself how I can live a more enjoyable and fulfilling life, 
            I was introduced to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102">The Millionaire Fastlane</a>,
            and from this book, I work daily on the 3 aspects that the author, <a href="https://www.mjdemarco.com/">MJ DeMarco</a>, believes
            contributes to "Real Wealth", namely:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fitness (health),</li>
            <li>Family (relationships), and</li>
            <li>Freedom (through financial freedom)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition to this, I have also been using self-hypnosis audio tracks from <a href="https://hypnosislive.com/">Hypnosis Live</a> 
            to support me on my journey.
        </p>
